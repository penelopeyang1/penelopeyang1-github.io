                            <h4>Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a passion for solving puzzles and bringing creative ideas to life. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me immersed in the worlds of video games and books as Iâ€™m all about combining precision and imagination both in my work and in everyday life.
                                For me, coding is more than just problem-solving, it's about creating something dynamic, efficient, and maybe even a little bit magical. Iâ€™m constantly learning, exploring new ideas, and honing my craft, whether it's working on personal coding projects, playing the violin, or discovering new corners of the world.
